# Randome Knowledge - October 2018

## Git
- In Git, since we can add any repository copy as a remote, it' so easy to collaborate. Linus certainly did help open source a great deal with this. And then there is Linux. Linus did some great job for open source.
- In `git branch` and `git checkout -b` you can also specify the starting point: `git checkout -b newBranch develop`

## JavaScript
- Look at this:
```javascript
function example() {
    try {
        return true;
    }
    catch {
        return false;
    }
    finally {
        return true;
    }
}
```

The above code will always return true because of finally. Read the discussion [here][1].

- Good to read: [Promises Finally...][2]
- ### How tools calculate coverage?
By parsing the code and inserting increment statements in between. For example, this code:
```javascript
function foo (a) {
    if (a) {
        // do something with 'a'.
    } else {
        // do something else.
    }
}
```
Gets transformed to:
```javascript
function foo(a) {
    cov_2mofekog2n.f[0]++;
    cov_2mofekog2n.s[0]++;
    if (a) {
        // do something with 'a'.
        cov_2mofekog2n.b[0][0]++;
    } else {
        // do something else.
        cov_2mofekog2n.b[0][1]++;
    }
}
```
where, `cov_2mofekog2n.f[0]++` indicates that the function foo was executed, `cov_2mofekog2n.s[0]++` indicates that a statement within this function was called, and `cov_2mofekog2n.b[0][0]++` and `cov_2mofekog2n.b[0][1]++` indicate that branches were executed. Based on these counts, reports can be generated.

## System Design
- Microservices architecture, instead of a monolith service, deploy several small service independently, for example auth service, cab booking service, route determination service, etc, i.e. instead of a single code acontaining /auth, /rides, /routes, etc endpoints, different deployments handle each of these separately, in fact each may choose different technology stack, based on what fits best for that service.
