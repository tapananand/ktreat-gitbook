## Git
- In Git, since we can add any repository copy as a remote, it' so easy to collaborate. Linus certainly did help open source a great deal with this. And then there is Linux. Linus did some great job for open source.
- In `git branch` and `git checkout -b` you can also specify the starting point: `git checkout -b newBranch develop`

## JavaScript
- Look at this:
```javascript
function example() {
    try {
        return true;
    }
    catch {
        return false;
    }
    finally {
        return true;
    }
}
```

The above code will always return true because of finally. Read the discussion [here][1].
