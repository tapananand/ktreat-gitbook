# Random Knowledge

This section contains random unstructured knowledge that I keep collecting by reading articles, watching videos, etc. There is a very thin line between the random ideas and this section.
Anything that isn't a very specific topic under any of the sections, will go under this section. 

But if the bullet point starts to grow too large, it should moved to a file of its own, either under this section or may be even in a section on the topic it belongs to.

## Git
- In Git, since we can add any repository copy as a remote, it' so easy to collaborate. Linus certainly did help open source a great deal with this. And then there is Linux. Linus did some great job for open source.
- In `git branch` and `git checkout -b` you can also specify the starting point: `git checkout -b newBranch develop`

## JavaScript
- Look at this:
```javascript
function example() {
    try {
        return true;
    }
    catch {
        return false;
    }
    finally {
        return true;
    }
}
```

The above code will always return true because of finally. Read the discussion [here][1].
