# Random Knowledge

This section contains random unstructured knowledge that I keep collecting by reading articles, watching videos, etc. There is a very thin line between the random ideas and this section.
Anything that isn't a very specific topic under any of the sections, will go under this section. 

But if the bullet point starts to grow too large, it should moved to a file of its own, either under this section or may be even in a section on the topic it belongs to.
