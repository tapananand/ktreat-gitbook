# Welcome to Ktreat

This is where I randomly write my notes about what I learn from day to day. Some are written very seriously, some are written in a very haphazard way.

## About me
I am a web app developer and a security enthusiast by choice. I am completely obsessed with learning new stuff on day to day basis 

My areas of interest include:

1. JavaScript and everything revolving around it.
2. Web Security
3. Machine Learning (well I am warming up to it...)

The content here is derived from tutorials, articles, videos, docs, projects, courses, etc that I go through throughout my time. So, the content may or may not be completely mine. I will try to give attributions at places, but if I miss it, please don't hold it against me and try reminding me of it politely first.
