# Random Ideas

Some random Ideas/thoughts that I have and are worth sharing will be listed under this section.

- 0.1 can't be expressed exactly in a binary expansion in a finite number of bits and that's why 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3. **But what if we expressed fractional numbers as 1/1010, i.e. use two binary numbers to express it, numerator and denominator?**
- Some good Web Tech history in [this article][1]. Must read.
- Tony Hoare created QuickSort and null reference. He calls null reference a Billion Dollar Mistake [now][2].
- A [good article][3] on testing react components with Enzyme and jest.
